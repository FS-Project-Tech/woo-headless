# 🚀 Performance Optimization Roadmap
## Headless Next.js + WooCommerce + WordPress + ACF

**Project Context:**
- Headless Next.js (App Router) + WordPress + WooCommerce + ACF
- Custom modules: user_assigned_products, wholesale pricing, dynamic discounts, product bundles, multiple billing/shipping
- Current APIs: WooCommerce REST API, WP REST API, custom PHP endpoints
- Hosting: VPS (Nginx), Redis available
- Goal: Improve API latency, GraphQL migration, caching, payload reduction, reliable cart/checkout, monitoring

---

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### API Usage Patterns
- **WooCommerce REST API**: Direct axios calls via `lib/woocommerce.ts`
- **WP REST API**: For media, users, ACF data
- **Custom PHP Endpoints**: For specialized features
- **Caching**: Basic Redis support in `lib/fetch-woo-data.ts`, but underutilized
- **Field Selection**: Limited use of `_fields` parameter

### Performance Bottlenecks Identified
1. **Multiple sequential API calls** for related data
2. **Large payloads** - fetching full product objects when only IDs/names needed
3. **No request batching** - each component makes separate API calls
4. **Limited caching strategy** - Redis available but not fully utilized
5. **No GraphQL** - complex queries require multiple REST calls
6. **Cart/checkout** - multiple validation calls, no request deduplication

## 🎯 Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Wins (Week 1-2)
1. ✅ **Enhanced Redis Caching**
   - Implement multi-layer caching (memory → Redis → API)
   - Smart cache invalidation strategies
   - Cache warming for popular data

2. ✅ **API Payload Optimization**
   - Consistent use of `_fields` parameter
   - Response compression
   - Field selection utilities

3. ✅ **Request Batching & Deduplication**
   - Batch multiple API calls into single requests
   - Deduplicate concurrent requests
   - Request queue management

### Phase 2: GraphQL Migration (Week 3-4)
1. ✅ **GraphQL Setup**
   - Install WPGraphQL + WooGraphQL plugins
   - Create GraphQL client utilities
   - Migrate heavy queries to GraphQL

2. ✅ **Hybrid Approach**
   - Use GraphQL for complex queries (products with filters, categories with products)
   - Keep REST for simple operations (cart updates, order creation)

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (Week 5-6)
1. ✅ **Optimized Endpoints**
   - Create specialized batch endpoints
   - Implement field-level caching
   - Add response compression middleware

2. ✅ **Cart/Checkout Reliability**
   - Idempotency keys (already implemented)
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Better error handling and recovery

### Phase 4: Monitoring & CI (Week 7-8)
1. ✅ **Monitoring Setup**
   - APM integration (Sentry, DataDog, or custom)
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Error tracking and alerting

2. ✅ **CI/CD Checks**
   - API performance benchmarks
   - Response time monitoring
   - Automated testing for critical flows

## 📋 Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Redis Caching

**File**: `lib/cache/redis-enhanced.ts`
- Multi-layer cache with fallbacks
- Smart TTL based on data type
- Cache tags for invalidation
- Cache warming strategies

**Benefits**:
- 80-90% reduction in API calls for cached data
- Sub-10ms response times for cached responses

### 2. GraphQL Integration

**Files**: 
- `lib/graphql/client.ts` - GraphQL client
- `lib/graphql/queries.ts` - Common queries
- `lib/graphql/mutations.ts` - Mutations

**Use Cases**:
- Product listings with complex filters
- Category trees with product counts
- User-specific product assignments
- Wholesale pricing queries

**Benefits**:
- Single request for complex data
- Reduced payload size (only requested fields)
- Better type safety

### 3. API Payload Optimization

**File**: `lib/api-optimizer.ts`
- Field selection utilities
- Response compression
- Payload size monitoring

**Benefits**:
- 50-70% reduction in payload size
- Faster network transfer
- Lower bandwidth costs

### 4. Request Batching

**File**: `lib/api-batcher.ts`
- Automatic request batching
- Request deduplication
- Queue management

**Benefits**:
- Reduced API calls by 60-80%
- Lower server load
- Better rate limit management

### 5. Monitoring & Observability

**Files**:
- `lib/monitoring/apm.ts` - APM integration
- `lib/monitoring/metrics.ts` - Metrics collection
- `lib/monitoring/errors.ts` - Error tracking

**Metrics Tracked**:
- API response times
- Cache hit rates
- Error rates
- Payload sizes
- Request counts

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **API Latency**: < 200ms (p95) for cached, < 500ms for uncached
- **Payload Size**: 50-70% reduction
- **Cache Hit Rate**: > 80%
- **API Calls**: 60-80% reduction
- **Cart/Checkout Success Rate**: > 99.5%

### Monitoring Dashboards
- Real-time API performance
- Cache effectiveness
- Error rates by endpoint
- User experience metrics

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

### Gradual Rollout
1. **Week 1-2**: Enhanced caching (non-breaking)
2. **Week 3-4**: GraphQL for new features, REST for existing
3. **Week 5-6**: Optimize existing endpoints
4. **Week 7-8**: Full monitoring and CI integration

### Rollback Plan
- Feature flags for all optimizations
- Ability to disable GraphQL and fallback to REST
- Cache can be disabled without breaking functionality
