# ✅ Checkout Flow Fix

## Issue
Checkout was redirecting directly to thank-you page instead of going through order review/confirmation page.

## Solution
Updated checkout flow to redirect to order review page after order creation.

---

## Updated Flow

### Before
1. Checkout page → Place Order
2. Order created → **Direct redirect to thank-you page**

### After
1. Checkout page → Place Order
2. Order created → **Redirect to order-review/confirmation page**
3. Order review page shows order details
4. User can continue shopping or view order details

---

## Changes Made

### `app/checkout/page.tsx`
- Changed redirect from `/checkout/thank-you?order_id={id}` to `/checkout/order-review?orderId={id}`
- Cart is cleared after successful order creation
- Success message shown before redirect

```typescript
// Before
router.replace(`/checkout/thank-you?order_id=${orderData.id}`);

// After
router.replace(`/checkout/order-review?orderId=${orderData.id}`);
```

## Order Review Page

The order review page (`/checkout/order-review`) already exists and:
- ✅ Fetches order details from WooCommerce
- ✅ Displays order number, items, and total
- ✅ Shows billing and shipping addresses
- ✅ Tracks purchase in analytics
- ✅ Provides "Continue Shopping" button
- ✅ Provides "View Order" link

---

## Complete Flow

1. **Checkout Page** (`/checkout`)
   - User fills billing, shipping, payment details
   - Clicks "Place Order"
   - Order created in WooCommerce
   - Cart cleared
   - Redirects to order review

2. **Order Review Page** (`/checkout/order-review?orderId={id}`)
   - Displays order confirmation
   - Shows order details, items, totals
   - User can review order
   - Options to continue shopping or view order

3. **Thank You Page** (`/checkout/thank-you?order_id={id}`)
   - Available if user navigates to it
   - Shows full order details
   - Alternative confirmation view

## Testing

✅ **Place Order** → Should redirect to `/checkout/order-review?orderId={id}`  
✅ **Order Review** → Should display order details correctly  
✅ **Cart Cleared** → Cart should be empty after order  
✅ **Continue Shopping** → Should work from order review page  

---

**Fix Complete! ✅**

The checkout flow now properly goes through the order review/confirmation page.
