### Form Validation
```typescript
// Billing fields - all required
billing: {
  first_name: required
  last_name: required
  email: email format + required
  phone: required
  address_1: required
  city: required
  postcode: required
  country: required
  state: required
}

// Shipping fields - conditional validation
shipping: {
  // Only required if shipToDifferentAddress is true
  first_name: conditional
  // ... other fields
}

// Other validations
shippingMethod: required
paymentMethod: required
termsAccepted: must be true
```

### Auto-fill Shipping
- When "Ship to different address" is unchecked, shipping fields auto-fill from billing
- Updates automatically when billing changes

### Dynamic Shipping Rates
- Fetches shipping rates based on selected country
- Updates when billing/shipping country changes
- Auto-selects first available rate

### Payment Processing

- COD: Order created with pending payment
- Bank Transfer: Order created with pending payment

## 🔄 Order Flow

1. **User fills form** → React Hook Form validates
2. **Submit clicked** → Validation runs
3. **Cart sync** → Syncs with WooCommerce for price validation
4. **Payment processing** → (If PayPal) Process payment
5. **Order creation** → POST to `/api/orders`
6. **Success** → Toast notification + redirect to thank you page
7. **Cart cleared** → Cart emptied after successful order

---

## 📝 Usage Example

### Access Checkout
```
/checkout?token={access_token}
```

### Form Submission
```typescript
// Form automatically handles:
- Validation
- Cart sync
- Payment processing
- Order creation
- Success redirect
```

### Success Response
```
Redirect: /checkout/thank-you?order_id=12345
